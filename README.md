## Autobiography
### From Hospitality and Social Science to Data Analytics: A Journey of Skills and Insights
Transitioning into the dynamic field of data analytics, I leverage a rich background in the hospitality industry and hold an undergraduate degree in International Relations and History from SOAS University of London. These experiences have equipped me with invaluable transferable skills, fostering a strong foundation for my venture into data analytics. My motivation stems from a fervor for discerning patterns, extracting insights, and crafting data-driven decisions; a passion that originated during my role in stock management at the Peppertree Thai Restaurant.

Rather than merely tallying inventory and recording quantities of each product, I proactively embraced the opportunity to acquire new skills. Taking the initiative, I dedicated myself to learning and cultivating a sophisticated Excel spreadsheet. This comprehensive tool not only facilitated precise stock tracking but also provided a bird's-eye view of the entire inventory. Through this hands-on experience, I discovered the transformative power of data in enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making.

In the realm of hospitality, I honed my interpersonal and communication skills, ensuring seamless interactions with diverse individuals. This experience has ingrained in me a deep understanding of customer needs; an asset that seamlessly translates into the realm of data analytics where customer insights are paramount.

My academic foundation in International Relations and History, in which I attained a 2:1, has cultivated critical thinking and research skills, enabling me to approach data with a nuanced perspective. The ability to analyse complex geopolitical scenarios and historical trends has equipped me with a unique analytical mindset that I now eagerly apply to real-world datasets.

In November 2023, I completed the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) __[Data Analytics Career Accelerator](https://github.com/Mattia-Bieler/LSE_Data_Analytics_Career_Accelerator.git)__ with a distinction. This immersive program equipped me with hands-on experience in various tools and languages, including Excel, Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. Armed with this proficiency, I am poised to apply my multidisciplinary background, analytical mindset, and technical skills to contribute meaningfully to data-driven projects.

This fusion of hospitality, social science, and data analytics positions me as a versatile professional, ready to tackle challenges and uncover insights in the evolving landscape of data-driven decision-making.
